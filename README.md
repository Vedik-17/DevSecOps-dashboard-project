# üõ°Ô∏è DevSecOps Executive Dashboard

An interactive dashboard application built with **React** and **Recharts**, designed to provide high-level insights into key **DevSecOps metrics** for **executive decision-making**. The dashboard helps visualize vulnerabilities, MTTR, scan coverage, compliance rates, and more‚Äîwith full support for custom JSON uploads and responsive design.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Overview Tab**: Summary of total vulnerabilities, critical ones, average MTTR, and scan coverage.
* **Vulnerabilities Tab**: View trends by severity over time and top affected applications.
* **Efficiency & Compliance Tab**: Analyze scan coverage, gate pass rates, compliance levels, and MTTR by severity.
* **Time Filtering**: Filter dashboard data by Last Month, 3, 6, or 12 Months.
* **Custom Data Upload**: Upload your own JSON to visualize specific organizational metrics.
* **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes.
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### üöÄ Steps to Run

#### 1. Create a New React Project (using Vite):

```bash
npm create vite@latest devsecops-dashboard-app -- --template react
```

* Choose `react` and `javascript` as options.

#### 2. Navigate to the Project:

```bash
cd devsecops-dashboard-app
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Install Recharts:

```bash
npm install recharts
```

#### 5. Replace App Content:

* Open `src/App.jsx`, remove all contents, and paste the full code from your dashboard's source (with inlined `<style>`).

#### 6. Clean Up Unused CSS:

* Make sure `src/index.css` or `src/App.css` is empty or deleted.
* In `src/main.jsx`, **comment/remove** any CSS imports like:

```js
// import './index.css'; // Remove this if present
```

```js
// src/main.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.jsx';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

#### 7. Start the Dev Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the dashboard.
